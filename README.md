The Digital Image Processing is one of the trend research fields in computer science.  In this paper there is an Image Processing application will be told. 

Project Butterfree is an application that covers some basic operations and some artistic filters in it. There are some basic operations like rotating an image to a specific angle or changing the brightness of the image. There are some artistic filters for example “One Autumn Leaf” that we created inspired of the love of an autumn and The King’s Avatar anime as well.
We are going to use a butterfree image as the original image in The Project Butterfree.
